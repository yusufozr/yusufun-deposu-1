    <h2><u><mark>Introduction to Node.js</mark></u></h2>
    <p>
        Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform <b>JavaScript</b> runtime environment. It is a popular tool 
        for almost any kind of project!
        Node.js runs the V8 <b>JavaScript</b> engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows
        Node.js to be very performant.
        A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js 
        provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent <b>JavaScript</b> code 
        from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making 
        blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
        When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the 
        filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the 
        operations when the response comes back.
        This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without 
        introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.
        Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write <b>JavaScript</b> for the 
        browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.
        In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for 
        all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to 
        use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by 
        running Node.js with flags.

    <h2><u><mark>An Example Node.js Application</mark></u></h2>
<p>The most common example Hello World of Node.js is a web server:</p>
<hr>
<u>
<p>CJS</p>
<p>MJS</p>
<p>const { createServer } = require('node:http');</p>
<p>const hostname = '127.0.0.1';</p>
<p>const port = 3000;</p>
<p>const server = createServer((req, res) => {</p>
  <p>res.statusCode = 200;</p>
  <p>res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');</p>
  <p>res.end('Hello World');</p>
<p>});</p>
</u>
<hr>
<p>server.listen(port, hostname, () => {</p>
    <p>console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);</p>
<p>});</p>
<p>To run this snippet, save it as a <mark>server.js</mark> file and run <mark>node server.js</mark> in your terminal. 
    If you use mjs version of the code, you should save it as a <mark>server.mjs</mark> file and run <mark>node server.mjs</mark> 
    in your terminal.</p>
<p>This code first includes the Node.js <mark>http</mark> <b>module</b></p>
<p>Node.js has a fantastic <b>standard library</b>, including first-class support for networking.</p>
<p>The <mark>createServer()</mark> method of <mark>http</mark> creates a new HTTP server and returns it.</p>
<p>The server is set to listen on the specified port and host name. When the server is ready, the callback function is called, in this case informing us that the server is running.</p>
<p>Whenever a new request is received, the <mark>request</mark> <b>event</b> is called, providing two objects: a request <mark>(an http.IncomingMessage object)</mark> and a response (an http.ServerResponse object).</p>
<p>Those 2 objects are essential to handle the HTTP call.</p>
